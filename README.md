# AcEntTree
This is a simple ARX application with MFC support to see structure of the selected entity 
in .dwg file. To call this from AutoCAD simply load an .arx file and call "robomax" command.

Also you will see coordinates of each primitive entity in the tree, but not all of them are supported.

Then hit "Select Block" and click on the entity. You will see a tree structure of the selected
entity.
